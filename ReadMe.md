# Overview

This code is designed to interact with a cloud database. This database
is a record of music and its use in media from tv shows, advertisements,
and film. I created a class for the Music so that I could more easily add
douments to the collection using a standard format across the collection.
There is code for adding, and modifying existing documents. I also have a 
snap_shot update.

I created this database to learn how to use a clooud database. I also wanted
a personal record of music used in media so I can find songs more easily.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}
